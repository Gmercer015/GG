/** \page design Design
   \section design_purpose Purpose 
   GG is designed to do achieve several goals:
   - Platform-independence: GG should be buildable on any platform that supports OpenGL and SDL
   - Easy extensibility: new controls and GUI behavior should be easy to incorporate
   - Complete graphical control for the user/designer: the user should not be limited by the authors' lack of artistic skill!
   - Independence of UI elements from the source code: GG UI elements should be configurable as text files, so that UI design 
   and alteration should not require a recompilation
   - Overall time efficiency: an application with a reasonable number of GG UI elements should not slow down significantly 
   because of the rendering or handling of those elements
   - Overall space efficiency: each GG UI element should have a reasonably small data size
   - Efficient mixture of 2D and 3D graphical elements: it should be appropriate to use GG in any frame-based 3D application, 
   even a realtime 3D video game
   - Simplicity of use: GG UI elements should be able to send arbitrary messages when manipulated by the user; there should be 
   no message passing hierarchy imposed on the user

/** \page architecture Architecture
   \section arch_rendering Rendering Overview
   GG uses OpenGL to render its graphics; it is assumed that the entire application is being redrawn multiple times each second.  
   Each GG UI element is draw using calls to OpenGL.  Therefore, each element can be rendered as a pre-rendered pixmap, flat 2D 
   mode graphic, or even a 3D mode rendering; the complexity of the graphics used to represent the UI elements is only limited
   by the target rendering hardware and the user's skill.
   \section arch_UI_overview UI Overview
   \subsection arch_input_events Input Events
   GG is organized as a layer on top of an existing user input framework.  GG has no way of determining that a mouse click, mouse move, 
   or any other user input event, has taken place.  To use GG, one must subclass off of the abstract class GG::App, and define several 
   of GG::App's pure virtual functions.  These functions poll the underlying operating system or input framework (by default the SDL),
   and generate GG input messages from them.  Such messages are mouse moves and clicks, key presses and releases, joystick movement, 
   etc. GG maintains internal state as to what part of the GUI is being dragged, clicked, etc.
   \subsection arch_UI_overview_example Example:
   Suppose the user clicks 
   the left mouse button at screen position (50, 37).  GG will receive a message from the underlying application framework that a 
   left mouse click has occurred; it then determines what UI element if any is under that screen location.  If it turns out there is
   a button under that spot, GG sets internal state indicating that the left mouse button is being held down, and that it is over the
   button.  GG then sends a message to the button that it is depressed.  The button sets its own internal state and returns.  All 
   processing is complete for this input; the next time the button is redrawn, it knows to draw itself in a depressed state.  Very
   little computation is involved in processing a single user input event.  GG's performance is therefore usually limited only by the
   application-defined processing that is associated with manipulating the controls (e.g., a button click may trigger disk IO).
   \subsection arch_UI_element_conns UI Element Connections
   GG UI elements are connected using signals and slots, using the boost.signals library implementation.  This allows arbitrary 
   connections between one control and another, and between a control and other code; there is no hierarchy of passed messages 
   as there is in some other GUIs, and there are no unsafe callbacks used.  Refer to the \ref sigs_n_slots documentation for details.
   \subsection arch_app_services GG::App Services
   The singleton GG::App object is globally available through a static member function, GG::App::GetApp().  This allows all code
   in the application to rely on GG::App for certain essential services.  GUI-specific services include registering windows into
   the GUI, registering windows as always-on-top or modal windows, moving windows up or down in the z-order layers of the GUI,
   removing windows from the GUI, getting mouse state (position and button depression), setting mouse delay repeat (see GG::App 
   for a description of this), entering and exiting from an orthographic projection (2D) rendering mode, and creating polymorphic
   GUI elements from XML-formatted text.  Most of these services must be provided by the user when subclassing from GG::App; 
   if SDLGGApp is used, these services are already implemented.
   <p>
   GG::App does a variety of things for the user, some of which are not strictly necessary for the core GUI functionality.  
   GG::App provides limited timing info via FPS() and DeltaT().  These are provided to indicate how fast the app is rendering, 
   and how long it has been since the last frame was rendered.  There is also a font manager, an application-wide font "pool",
   from which the user can request fonts.  The font pool loads and renders the fonts as needed by the application, and multiple 
   requests for the same font at the same size will result in the creation of only one rendered font object.  A texture manager
   exists which does a similar job with textures.  If the user wants to programmatically create textures, she can also add them
   to the texture pool, provide a name, and request that texture as many times as needed.  OpenGL texture objects are used in
   the underlying texture rendering method.

/** \page sigs_n_slots Signals and Slots
   \section sigs_n_slots_definition Sig-who? Slo-what?
   If you've never been exposed to the signals and slots pattern before, it can be a little confusing.  Simply put, a slot is a
   function or funtion object that is "listening" for a signal.  A slot "listening" to a certain signal is said to be connected 
   to that signal.  When a signal is emitted, all slots that are connected to that signal invoke their function(s)/function 
   object(s).  If a signal is emitted to which no slots are connected, nothing happens.
   \section sigs_n_slots_motivation Motivation for the Signals and Slots Pattern
   \subsection prob The Problem
   Originally, GG used a very simple strategy for passing messages between windows/controls.  The method was to 
   call a Command() function, which passed to the caller an integer representing the type of message (button click, scroll, or
   whatever), an ID number associated with the calling control, and a single integer parameter.  It could have been made more 
   general and a lot less typesafe by replacing the int parameter with a void pointer, but in either case it suffers from three
   huge limitations.  First, the type of message and the paramter must be known to both caller and callee; this means that, for
   example, the user must keep track of the integer value representing a button click message, and make sure that separate 
   sections of code are using the same value to represent it.  Second, each control must call its parent and tell it about 
   each event that occurs, meaning that the callee has to maintain state information.  For instance, consider a dialog that 
   contains a list box.  Say the dialog does some lengthy bit of processing whenever the user clears the dialog box by pushing 
   another button in the dialog.  With the simple Command()-call scheme, any list box will notify its parent (in this case, the 
   dialog) whenever it is cleared.  Say also that if the user presses the "c" key, the dialog will catch the event and clear 
   the list box.  Once cleared, the list box will dutifully send its cleared message to the dialog.  So to differentiate 
   between messages from a button-cleared list box and a keystroke-cleared one, the dialog box has to enter a state indicating 
   that it has just cleared its list box before doing so, if it doesn't want to do the lengthy button-cleared processing after 
   a "c"-key press.  This is a simple example.  In reality, things get real hairy real fast.  Third, since the controls always 
   call their parents, any code that doesn't contain a control, but that wants to know about button pushes, scrolling 
   scrollbars, etc., must deal with that control's parent; this creates a lot of chains of passed messages, and a fair number 
   of kludges to get messages to the sections of code that need them.
   \subsection sigs_n_slots_soln The Solution
   Now, each control emits a signal every time a significant event occurs.  If no processing needs to be associated with such
   an event, its signal need not be connected to anything.  On the other hand, no matter how many modules need to react to a 
   certain signal, they can all be connected.  In the case of our previous example, the list box-clearing button in the dialog 
   can just create a temporary connection between the dialog and the list box, then clear the list box (so then when the list 
   box signals it has been cleared, the dialog will do the appropriate processing).  When the list box is cleared with a 
   "c"-key press, no such connection needs to be made.  No state information is needed in the dialog.
   \section sigs_n_slots_use Using Signals and Slots
   \subsection sigs_n_slots_connecting Connecting Signals To Slots
   There are two types of connections between signals and slots.  The first type of connection is between a signal and a 
   slot, which may be a functor (which may be a boost::bind object), a free function or a static member function.  Just call 
   Connect(sig, slot).  The second type is between a signal and a non-static member function.  In this case, the call to 
   Connect() requires a third parameter: a pointer to the object whose member function is to be called.  For instance, if I 
   have a class Foo and an object foo of class Foo, I cannot call foo.bar() by simply knowing the address of bar().  I need 
   to call Connect(sig, &Foo::bar, &foo) so that the signal knows which object's bar() to call.  Both versions of Connect()
   return a connection object.  By keeping this connection object, you can later disconnect() the connection you made.
   \subsection sigs_n_slots_emitting Emitting Signals
   To emit a signal, just call its () operator, like this: sig();
   \subsection disconnecting Disconnecting Signals and Slots
   If you kept the connection object returned by Connect(), a connection_obj.disconnect() call will disconnect the associated 
   signal and slot.  Also, consider this: what happens if a non-static member function slot and signal are connected, the 
   object owning the slot is destructed, and the signal is emitted?  A segfault, unless the object's class inherits from 
   boost::trackable, which auto-disconnects slots on object destruction.  See the boost tutorial below for details.
   \see http://boost.org/libs/signals/doc/tutorial.html for a tutorial on other aspects of signals and slots; you can create 
   connections that have scope, control the order of the invocation of multiple slots that are called by a signal, and combine 
   the return values of such slots (take the first return value, the last, the average of all of them, etc.).

/** \page XML_IO Object Serialization using XML
   \section XML_IO_motivation Motivation
   One of the main design goals for GG is the editability of UI elements without recompilation.  Another main goal is the 
   capability of saving and restoring the state of the GUI.  A secondary design goal is the capability of serializing UI
   elements for network transmission and receipt.  To satisfy all these requirements, GG uses an object serialization 
   approach based on XML.  XML objects are trivial to parse using libexpat, and are not much harder to create.  In addition,
   they produce human-readable (if not always human-comprehensible) bytestreams.  When saved to files, these can be edited
   by hand, obviating the need for a recompile just to change the appearance of a window or button.
   \section XML_IO_approach Approach
   GG's serialization approach is two-fold:  1) objects are converted to and constructed from GG::XMLElement objects 
   by the user, and 2) if necessary, when objects from polymorphic class hierarchies are received in XML-formatted text, 
   they can be created using GG::XMLObjectFactory.  This allows the user to specify the type of each object when the XML
   text is created, then read back that type from the XML text later and correctly recreate objects of the right type 
   automatically.
   \section XML_IO_encode_parse XML Encoding and Parsing   
   To encode an object, you need to provide a function similar to GG::Wnd::XMLEncode() to create an GG::XMLElement.  To 
   construct an object from the XML encoding, you need to provide a constructor that accepts a GG::XMLElement.  In the
   sections below, it is assumed that we are trying to represent a single object in a GG::XMLElement.  This technique is 
   very flexible, so the sections below are only a suggestion.  The techniques outlined are used in saving and restoring 
   GG objects.  To save objects to file or send them over a network connection, put them into a GG::XMLDoc and send them 
   to a file or stringstream (or any other kind of std::ostream, actually), using GG::XMLDoc::WriteDoc().
   \subsection XML_IO_rep_integral_typ Representing Integral Type Members
   Each member should be represented by a tag.  Integral type members should be represented by a tag with a single attribute,
   "value".  The tag will generally look like this: 
   \verbatim
   <m_float_member value="3.14159"/>\endverbatim
   It is convenient to use boost::lexical_cast, which is defined on all integral types, to go from a value to a string, and 
   from a string to a value.
   \subsection XML_IO_rep_class Representing Class and Struct Object Members
   Each class member should be enclosed within a tag for its name, and should be otherwise treated as a non-member object:
   \verbatim
   <m_point_class_member>
      <MyNameSpace::PointClass>
         <m_x value="18"/>
         <m_y value="36"/>
      </MyNameSpace::PointClass>
   </m_point_class_member>\endverbatim
   \subsection XML_IO_rep_std_strings Representing std::strings
   Since strings may contain newlines, quotes, and a whole host of other characters that will not work with the value=""
   method above, a special method must be used to represent strings in a fully general way.  Each XMLElement has a text field,
   which is designed specifically to hold strings of non-XML-tag text.  To store a string, simply set its text:
   \verbatim
   <m_string_member>"Anything can go here, even
"newlines" and "quotes""</m_string_member>\endverbatim
   Everything that goes between the outer quotes will be parsed as belonging to the text field of the XMLElement, so 
   whitespace after a newline will be incorporated.  The final quote in the string must be either the last thing on its 
   line or must be followed immediately by a tag.
   \subsection XML_IO_rep_heap_obj Representing Pointer Members
   Since we've defined constructors that take a GG:XMLElement for each class that will be serialized, saving pointers is very
   similar to saving other members.  The only difference is that you need to construct objects on the heap when recreating 
   them, as opposed to creating them on the stack: "m_ptr_to_point = new PointClass(xml_element)", instead of "m_ptr_to_point = 
   PointClass(xml_element)".
   \subsection XML_IO_rep_array Representing Arrays and Containers of Integral Types
   Arrays should be represented just as regular integral types, except that each array element should be given an attribute.
   The attribute for the ith element should be "indexi":
   \verbatim
   <m_float_arr index0="3.14159" index1="0.0" index2="1.0"/>\endverbatim
   STL Containers that contain integral types can be done in the same manner, for simplicity.  In the alternative, each 
   entry would be represented by an attribute in a new tag, similar to the containers in the next section.
   \subsection XML_IO_rep_containers Representing Other Container Members
   most containers can be treated as follows.  To encode the container, create a tag for the container variable, then 
   iterate through the elements of the container, and append the encoding of each one to the container tag.  To recreate 
   the container, read each contained object and create an object from it and add each created object to the container object
   in the order read.  So containers will look like this in the case of a container of class objects:
   \verbatim
   <m_point_vec>
      <MyNameSpace::PointClass>
         <m_x value="18"/>
         <m_y value="36"/>
      </MyNameSpace::PointClass>
      <MyNameSpace::PointClass>
         <m_x value="18"/>
         <m_y value="45"/>
      </MyNameSpace::PointClass>
      <MyNameSpace::PointClass>
         <m_x value="18"/>
         <m_y value="61"/>
      </MyNameSpace::PointClass>
   </m_point_vec>\endverbatim
   For containers of integral types, the array representation method may be useful.
   \section XML_IO_examples Examples
   Examples of all the techniques outlined here can be found in the GG::Wnd-dervied classes, including those derived from
   GG::Control.
   \section XML_IO_using_factory Using the GG::XMLObjectFactory
   GG::XMLObjectFactory is very simple to use.  For each class in the hierarchy, just create a function that creates a new 
   object and returns a pointer to it; the pointer's type should be the base class of the hierarchy.  Pass a name for each 
   class and a pointer to each function to the factory via GG::XMLObjectFactory::AddGenerator(), and later you can call 
   GG::XMLObjectFactory::GenerateObject(name) to create an object of that type.  For instance, if you create a subclass of 
   GG::Scroll called GG::Slider, you can create this function:
   \verbatim
   Wnd* NewSlider(const XMLElement& elem) {return new Slider(elem);}\endverbatim
   and make this call, using GG::App's GG::Wnd factory:
   \verbatim
   GG:App::GetApp()->AddWndGenerator("GG::Slider", &NewSlider);\endverbatim
   If you have a GG::Slider in the child list of any window, after this call any call to the window's XMLEncode() or the its 
   contructor will correctly encode or recreate the GG::Slider automatically.
   <p>
   Since GG::XMLObjectFactory is templated, you can create factories that construct objects from any polymorphic 
   class hierarchy.  The use of GG::XMLObjectFactory is not limited to the GG::Wnd-based class hierarchy.  
   \see Refer to GGApp.cpp for an example.

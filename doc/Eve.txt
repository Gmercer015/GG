/** \page eve_button button()

    button() creates a push-button (e.g. "OK" or "Cancel"), with some
    additional features.  Clicking a button may have a local effect, such as
    assigning a value to a cell in an Adam property sheet, or may indicate
    that some other action should be taken.  In the latter case, such clicks
    are given to the button handler.

    \section eve_button_interaction_semantics User Interaction Semantics

    The semantics of a button press are represented in this pseudocode:

    \verbatim
if bind_output is defined:
    adam_cell(bind_output) = value
else:
    if bind is defined:
        button_handler(action, {value: contributing})
    else:
        button_handler(action, value)\endverbatim

    Briefly, if \a bind_output is defined, \a value is assigned to the Adam
    property sheet cell with the name \a bind_output.  Otherwise, the button
    handler is called with \a action as its first argument.  If \a bind is
    defined, the second argument is a dictionary containing ( \a value, \a
    contributing ) as its only elemement; if \a bind is not defined, the
    second argument to the button handler is just \a value.

    \section eve_button_adam_interaction Adam Interaction Notes

    If \a bind is defined, the value emitted by the button will be the value
    of the bound cell (otherwise, it is \a value).

    \section eve_button_usage button() Usage

    \code button(param: value, param: value, ...); \endcode

    \param name The text that appears on the button.
    \param alt The tooltip text that appears when the cursor hovers over the button.
    \param bind The cell in the Adam property sheet to which this button is bound.  If defined, \a bind makes \a value moot.
    \param bind_output The cell in the Adam property sheet to which the output of this button is bound.  The \a bind_output cell will be assigned \a value.  When \a bind_output is specified, the button handler is not notified of this button's presses, making \a action moot.
    \param action The action associated with this button.  The button handler (if available) will be called with \a action as its first argument.
    \param value The value associated with this button.  This value is emitted when the button is pressed.  The value may be assigned to an Adam property sheet cell (see \a bind_output), or passed as the second argument in a call to the button handler (see button()'s main description).
    \param default If true, this button will be clicked when its modifiers are depressed (if any) and either return or enter is pressed.
    \param cancel If true, this button will be clicked when its modifiers are depressed (if any) and escape is pressed.
    \param items An array of dictionaries, each of which represents a state of the button, each with its own text, tooltip, etc.  Each dictionary contains an independent set of parameters, each of which has the same meaning for this button state as it would for the overall button if it were given outside of \a items.

    \section eve_button_items_usage items Usage

    \code items: [ { param: value, param: value, ... }, { param: value, param: value, ... }, ... ] \endcode

    \param name See above.
    \param alt See above.
    \param bind See above.
    \param bind_output See above.
    \param action See above.
    \param value See above.

    Additionally, each item may contain one or more modifier keys that must be
    depressed for a click or keypress to register:

    \param modifiers A single modifier key.
    \param modifier_set An array of modifier keys.

    \section eve_button_handler The Button Handler

    GG's UI creation functions all accept a user-defined GG::ButtonHandler.
    This handler accepts an adobe::name_t action name and an
    adobe::any_regular_t value.  It is called by Eve buttons under the
    circumstances outlined in \ref eve_button_interaction_semantics.  This
    mechanism allows the user to hook custom functionality into any Eve
    interface.  Note that, as described in \ref
    eve_button_interaction_semantics, the value parameter passed to the
    handler may include contributing cells.

    \section eve_button_predefined_actions Predefined Actions

    Some values of \a action have predefined meanings, and are handled by the
    Eve engine before they ever reach the button handler.  Currently, there is
    only one such action, "reset".  Clicking a button whose action is "reset"
    will cause the entire containing UI to have its original values reset to
    what they were when the UI was launched.

/** \page eve_checkbox checkbox()
    checkbox() creates a checkbox.

    \section eve_checkbox_interaction_semantics User Interaction Semantics

    Clicking on a checkbox causes a value to be assigned to the bound cell, if

    \a value_off when the click unchecks it.

    \section eve_checkbox_adam_interaction Adam Interaction Notes

/** \page eve_image image()
    image() creates an image.

    \section eve_image_interaction_semantics User Interaction Semantics

    Eve images emit metadata when a cursor drag occurs in the image.  The
    metadata is a dictionary with the following contents:

    \param delta_x The cursor's x coordinate, relative to the start position of the drag.
    \param delta_y The cursor's y coordinate, relative to the start position of the drag.
    \param dragging Whether the cursor is being dragged.
    \param x The cursor's current x coordinate.
    \param y The cursor's current y coordinate.

    During the drag, the above metadata values are assigned to the bound cell.
    At the end of the drag, the above metadata are emitted one final time,
    with \a dragging set to \c false, and \a delta_x and \a delta_x both set
    to \c 0.

    \section eve_image_adam_interaction Adam Interaction Notes

    The image expects a the view-bound Adam cell to set a texture.  The
    built-in function \ref eve_expression_image_fn can be used to specify a
    texture.  The image emits metadata, as described above.  This makes using
    \a bind problematic.  \a bind_controller and \a bind_view should be used
    instead.

/** \page eve_number_unit Number Unit
    Displays of numbers in Eve is often controlled by a "unit" specification.
    The unit for a number includes more than just the unit.  For instance, the
    \link eve_number_format format \endlink for display of the number is also
    covered.

    A unit is a specific set of named parameters.  Some Eve views (e.g. \link
    eve_display_number display_number \endlink) have a \a units parameter that
    is an array of dictionaries.  Each dictionary in the array is a unit
    specification, containing named parameters.  In addition, the unit
    parameters present in the view outside of the \a units parameter define
    the "default unit" of the view.  For example, this

    \code display_number(name: "Example:",
               bind: @value,
               format: "#.00",
               units: [

    \endlink of "#.00".  It also has a single non-default unit named
    "some_unit", with a \link eve_number_format format \endlink of "#".

    Note that views organized like this may contain a default unit,
    non-default units, neither, or both.

    \section eve_number_unit_usage Number Unit Usage

    \code param: value, param: value, ... \endcode

    \param name The name of the unit (e.g. centimeters).
    \param short_name The short name of the unit (e.g. cm for centimeters).
    \param bind The cell in the Adam property sheet to which the displayed number is bound, when in this unit.  Note that this can vary from unit to unit.  For instance, if one unit is "meters" and another is "seconds", it makes no sense to bind these units to the same cell.
    \param min_max_filter TODO
    \param format A string specifying how the number should be displayed (see \ref eve_number_format).
    \param min_value The minimum value of the displayed number allowed in this unit. TODO
    \param max_value The maximum value of the displayed number allowed in this unit. TODO
    \param scale An array of one or two numbers.  The first number is a scale factor; the second is an offset.
    \param increment In some instances the user is able to increment the value. This specifies the amount (in this unit) by which to increment the number.

    \note The canonical way to display a number in multiple levels of
    precision is to define a different \a scale for each unit.  Eve will
    select the most appropriate unit.  For example:
    \code display_number(name: "Bytes:",
               bind: @bytes,

    for users to add their own views as well.

    \note Eve layouts can contain property cells, like those in an Adam
    property sheet.  In the documentation pages below, reference is often
    generically made to a view's "bound cell".  Other times, cells are
    explicitly referred to as being in the Adam property sheet (and this is
    generally the case).  However, cells in a view's own Eve sheet are
    considered first, before Adam sheet cells.  If a view binds to a cell foo,
    and both its Adam and Eve sheets have cells called foo, the Eve cell will
    be bound.

/** \page eve_button button()
    button() creates a push-button (e.g. "OK" or "Cancel"), with some
    additional features.  Clicking a button may have a local effect, such as
    assigning a value to a cell in an Adam property sheet, or may indicate
    that some other action should be taken.  In the latter case, such clicks
    are given to the button handler.

    \section eve_button_interaction_semantics User Interaction Semantics

    The semantics of a button press are represented in this pseudocode:

    \verbatim
if bind_output is defined:
    adam_cell(bind_output) = value
else:
    if bind is defined:
        button_handler(action, {value: contributing})
    else:
        button_handler(action, value)\endverbatim

    Briefly, if \a bind_output is defined, \a value is assigned to the Adam
    property sheet cell with the name \a bind_output.  Otherwise, the button
    handler is called with \a action as its first argument.  If \a bind is
    defined, the second argument is a dictionary containing ( \a value, \a
    contributing ) as its only elemement; if \a bind is not defined, the
    second argument to the button handler is just \a value.

    \section eve_button_adam_interaction Adam Interaction Notes

    If \a bind is defined, the value emitted by the button will be the value
    of the bound cell (otherwise, it is \a value).

    \section eve_button_usage button() Usage

    \code button(param: value, param: value, ...); \endcode

    \ref eve_common_view_params

    \param name The text that appears on the button.
    \param alt The tooltip text that appears when the cursor hovers over the button.
    \param bind The cell in the Adam property sheet to which this button is bound.  If defined, \a value is ignored.
    \param bind_output The cell in the Adam property sheet to which the output of this button is bound.  The \a bind_output cell will be assigned \a value.  When \a bind_output is specified, the button handler is not notified of this button's presses, and so \a action is ignored.
    \param action The action associated with this button.  The button handler (if available) will be called with \a action as its first argument.
    \param value The value associated with this button.  This value is emitted when the button is pressed.  The value may be assigned to an Adam property sheet cell (see \a bind_output), or passed as the second argument in a call to the button handler (see button()'s main description).
    \param default If true, this button will be clicked when its modifiers are depressed (if any) and either return or enter is pressed.
    \param cancel If true, this button will be clicked when its modifiers are depressed (if any) and escape is pressed.
    \param items An array of dictionaries, each of which represents a state of the button, each with its own text, tooltip, etc.  Each dictionary contains an independent set of parameters, each of which has the same meaning for this button state as it would for the overall button if it were given outside of \a items.

    \param modifiers A single modifier key.
    \param modifier_set An array of modifier keys.

    \section eve_button_handler The Button Handler

    GG's UI creation functions all accept a user-defined GG::ButtonHandler.
    This handler accepts an adobe::name_t action name and an
    adobe::any_regular_t value.  It is called by Eve buttons under the
    circumstances outlined in \ref eve_button_interaction_semantics.  This
    mechanism allows the user to hook custom functionality into any Eve
    interface.  Note that, as described in \ref
    eve_button_interaction_semantics, the value parameter passed to the
    handler may include contributing cells.

    \section eve_button_predefined_actions Predefined Actions

    Some values of \a action have predefined meanings, and are handled by the
    Eve engine before they ever reach the button handler.  Currently, there is
    only one such action, "reset".  Clicking a button whose action is "reset"
    will cause the entire containing UI to have its original values reset to
    what they were when the UI was launched.

/** \page eve_number_unit Number Unit
    Displays of numbers in Eve is often controlled by a "unit" specification.
    The unit for a number includes more than just the unit.  For instance, the
    \link eve_number_format format \endlink for display of the number is also
    covered.

    A unit is a specific set of named parameters.  Some Eve views (e.g. \link
    eve_display_number display_number \endlink) have a \a units parameter that
    is an array of dictionaries.  Each dictionary in the array is a unit
    specification, containing named parameters.  In addition, the unit
    parameters present in the view outside of the \a units parameter define
    the "default unit" of the view.  For example, this

    \code display_number(name: "Example:",
               bind: @value,
               format: "#.00",
               units: [
                   { name: "some_unit", format: "#" }
               ]
              ); \endcode

    has a default unit with no name, and a \link eve_number_format format
    \endlink of "#.00".  It also has a single non-default unit named
    "some_unit", with a \link eve_number_format format \endlink of "#".

    Note that views organized like this may contain a default unit,
    non-default units, neither, or both.

    \param name The name of the unit (e.g. centimeters).
    \param short_name The short name of the unit (e.g. cm for centimeters).
    \param bind The cell in the Adam property sheet to which the displayed number is bound, when in this unit.  Note that this can vary from unit to unit.  For instance, if one unit is "meters" and another is "seconds", it makes no sense to bind these units to the same cell.
    \param format A string specifying how the number should be displayed (see \ref eve_number_format).
    \param min_value The minimum allowed value of the displayed number in this unit.
    \param max_value The maximum allowed value of the displayed number in this unit.
    \param scale An array of one or two numbers.  The first number is a scale factor; the second is an offset.
    \param increment In some instances the user is able to increment the value. This specifies the amount (in this unit) by which to increment the number.

    \note The canonical way to display a number in multiple levels of
    precision is to define a different \a scale for each unit.  Eve will
    select the most appropriate unit.  For example:
    \code display_number(name: "Bytes:",
               bind: @bytes,
               format: "#.##",

/** \page eve_adding_user_views Adding User-Defined Eve Views

    Users can define their own Eve views (widgets, layouts, etc.) and add them
    to the Eve engine, to be used in Adam and Eve scripts just like the
    built-in Eve views.

    \section Overview

    Most GG/Eve views consists of several parts:

    \li \a G, a GG::Wnd-derived class implementing the visual and user-interface elements of the view. Some Eve views are implemented in terms of other views, and so do not directly use an underlying \a G.
    \li \a W, a widget type that Eve uses to represent the view.  The widget uses \a G in its implementation.
    \li \a F, a factory function, and associated Eve factory code specializations for \a W.  \a F is registered and associated with a name, allowing the view to be used by name in Eve scripts.

    The \ref eve_display_text view is not part of the Adobe set of Eve views;
    it is a GG extension.  We will use it as an example here to demonstrate
    how to hook a new view into the Eve engine.

    First, a widget type must be defined.

    \section platform_display_text_hpp platform_display_text.hpp:

    In this example, the widget type is in namespace \a adobe, but this is not
    necessary; the widget type may be declared in whatever namespace you find
    convenient, and can have any name you like.

    \dontinclude platform_display_text.hpp
    \skip #ifndef
    \until boost::noncopyable
    \until {

    \a model_type is the type of the value that this view is a view of.  In
    this case, we use adobe::any_regular_t instead of std::string, because \a
    display_text can accept other Adam and Eve expression types besides just
    string (e.g. name).

    \until int characters_m;

    All Eve widgets require \a measure(), \a place(), and \a display().  This
    one also requires \a measure_vertical(), since this widget models
    PlaceableTwoPassConcept (see factory code below).

    \until };

    This function is used by the Eve code as a generic way to get a pointer to
    the underlying GG::Wnd-derived object from any widget type.

    \until #endif

    \section platform_display_text_cpp platform_display_text.cpp:

    Here is the actual implementation of the \a display_text_t widget.  Full
    documentation of what all this code means is beyond the scope of this
    document.  However, most of the code below is straightforward.  Moreover,
    by following the pattern of the existing widget implementations, it should
    be relatively straightforward to write an implementation like that below.

    \dontinclude platform_display_text.cpp
    \skip #include
    \until return display.insert(parent, get_display(element));
    \until }
    \until }

    Next, a factory function must be defined.

    \section display_text_factory_hpp display_text_factory.hpp:
    \dontinclude display_text_factory.hpp
    \skip #ifndef
    \until #endif

    In this example, the factory function is in namespace \a
    adobe::implementation, but this is not necessary; the factory function may
    be declared in whatever namespace you find convenient, and can have any
    name you like.  However, it must have the signature shown above.

    \section display_text_factory_cpp display_text_factory.cpp:

    The implementation of the factory function will reuse much of the Adobe
    code.  In fact, the body of the actual factory function is often trivial,
    as it is below.  However, there are other functions that must be defined
    that the Adobe code requires.  The most typical kind of view only requires
    you to define the factory function itself and \a create_widget() (see
    below).  If your view is atypical in some way, as \a display_text_t is,
    you should find a view with similar semantics, and pattern your factory
    code after its factory implementation.

    \dontinclude display_text_factory.cpp
    \skip namespace adobe
    \line namespace adobe

    \a create_widget() is the other function that the Adobe code requires.  It
    takes a dictionary of parameters, a size that is ignored in the current GG
    implementation, and a reference to a pointer to the widget begin created.
    \a create_widget() is called within \a create_and_hookup_widget<>() (see
    below), and is responsible for grabbing the parameters relevant to the
    view, and using them to construct the widget object.

    \until new display_text_t
    \until }

    This function is not always required, but it is specialized here for \a
    display_text_t so that the generic version called within \a
    create_and_hookup_widget<>() is not called.  The generic version ties the
    value of the view to its bound cell, so that when the view's value
    changes, the bound cell is assigned the new value.  However, \a
    display_text_t is not supposed to assign to its controller-bound cell, so
    this specialization is purposely a no-op.

    \until const widget_factory_t& factory)
    \until {

    Here is the body of the factory function, and it is indeed trivial.  The
    only thing to note here is the use of \a poly_placeable_twopass_t as the
    second template parameter to \a create_and_hookup_widget<>().  \a
    poly_placeable_t may be used as well.  \a poly_placeable_twopass_t applies
    to a view whose height depends on its width.  \a poly_placeable_t is for a
    view whose height and width are independent.  See the <a
    href="http://stlab.adobe.com/group__placeable__concept.html">Adobe
    documentation</a> for details.

    \until factory.layout_attributes
    \until }
    \until }
    \until }

    Finally, somewhere, the factory function needs to be registered so that it
    is actually available when an Eve script is parsed:

    \code GG::RegisterView(adobe::static_name_t("display_text"), &adobe::implementation::make_display_text); \endcode

    \section eve_views Views

    The term that Eve uses to describe Eve widgets and layout elements is
    "view".  Below are the views built in to the Eve engine.  It is possible
    for users to add their own views as well.

    All the views below have parameters that control their placement.  These
    are documented in \ref eve_common_view_params.

    Note that all views are constructed with a function-like syntax, with a
    named-parameter interface.  Adding extra named parameters that don't apply
    to a certain view have no effect.  For instance, it is always fine to add
    the parameter \code foo: "bar" \endcode to any view in an Eve sheet.

    \note Eve layouts can contain property cells, like those in an Adam
    property sheet.  In the documentation pages below, reference is often
    generically made to a view's "bound cell".  Other times, cells are
    explicitly referred to as being in the Adam property sheet (and this is
    generally the case).  However, cells in a view's own Eve sheet are
    considered first, before Adam sheet cells.  If a view binds to a cell foo,
    and both its Adam and Eve sheets have cells called foo, the Eve cell will
    be bound.
